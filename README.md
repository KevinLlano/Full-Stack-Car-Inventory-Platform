# AWS FullStack Inventory Management System


http://my-ebs-env.eba-pwmcdgmn.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/mainscreen   *NO LONGER HOSTED!*
## Overview

This project demonstrates inventory management by filtering for engine parts and car products. It includes indexing as well as search functionality for either parts or products. CRUD is used in the project to create, update, and delete engine parts and car products. The theme of the project focuses on car products which will be car models in this case, with engine parts corresponding to each product.

## Features

* **Comprehensive Inventory Management**. Manage and maintain a detailed inventory of car parts and products.
* **Advanced Search and Filtering**. Quickly locate specific car parts or products using the powerful search and filter functionalities.
* **CRUD Operations**. Users can seamlessly add new parts or products, update existing records, and delete items that are no longer needed.
* **User-Friendly Interface**. Includes buttons for adding in-house or outsourced parts, as well as update and delete actions for each item, ensuring smooth navigation.
* **Downloadable CSV Report**. Export current inventory into a CSV file for audits or records.
* **UI Part/Model Association**. Assign multiple parts to products with a clean visual interface.


## Technologies Used

* **Backend**: Spring Boot
* **Frontend**: React ‚Äì [Frontend Repo](https://github.com/KevinLlano/React-Frameworks2.0.git)
* **Database**: H2 (Development), PostgreSQL (Production)
* **Hosting**: AWS EC2, AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
* **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform

**Libraries & Tools**:
- Terraform

## UML Overview

The system models a **many-to-many** relationship between Products and Parts using a `product_part` join table.

* **Products** = car models with ID, name, price, inventory
* **Parts** = either **InhousePart** (includes part ID) or **OutsourcedPart** (includes company name)
* Uses **single-table inheritance** for part types

* **Maven**
* **Node.js & npm**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KevinLlano/Java-Frameworks2.0.git
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

URL: `http://localhost:8080`

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

URL: `http://localhost:3000`

---

## Usage

* Use buttons to **add/update/delete** inhouse and outsourced parts
* **Associate parts with products**
* **Search** parts/products by name/type
* **Export inventory** via "Download CSV Report" button

---

## Step 4: AWS Deployment

```bash
./mvnw clean package
eb init -p java-17 car-inventory-app
eb create car-parts-inventory-env
eb deploy
```

RDS setup:

* Create PostgreSQL RDS on AWS Console
* Update `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://<rds-endpoint>:5432/car_parts_inventory
spring.datasource.username=your_user
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

# Unit Testing

## Tools

* JUnit 5
* Mockito
* Spring MVC (Model)

## Key Tests

* **MainScreenControllerTest**

  * Validates `listPartsandProducts()` method using mock services
* **DeletePartValidatorTest**

  * Checks if part is safe to delete (no linked product)

## Test Sample

```java
when(mockPartService.listAll("")).thenReturn(Collections.emptyList());
verify(mockModel).addAttribute("parts", Collections.emptyList());
assertEquals("mainscreen", result);
```

## ‚úÖ Pass Criteria

* Model receives correct attributes
* View returned is `"mainscreen"`

# Authentication & Authorization

This project uses Keycloak for authentication and authorization to secure backend endpoints.

**Setup Overview:**
- Keycloak was deployed via Docker and configured with a dedicated realm and client for the backend.
- Spring Boot was integrated with Keycloak using the `keycloak-spring-boot-starter` and `spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server` dependencies.
- Backend endpoints are protected using JWT tokens issued by Keycloak. Only authenticated users can access protected resources.
- Users and clients are managed in Keycloak; tokens are obtained via the OpenID Connect password grant and used as Bearer tokens in API requests.
- Example endpoint `/api/secure` demonstrates how authentication is enforced and can be tested using Postman with a valid access token.

**Key Steps:**
1. Start Keycloak and create a realm and client for the backend.
2. Configure Spring Boot with Keycloak settings in `application.properties`.
3. Protect endpoints using Spring Security and JWT validation.
4. Obtain a token from Keycloak and use it to access secured endpoints.
